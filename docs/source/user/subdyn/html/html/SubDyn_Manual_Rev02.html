<p>Preface</p>
<p>This manual offers both a quick reference guide and a more in-depth
theory guide for the SubDyn software program. It is intended to be used
by the general user in combination with the FAST and HydroDyn manuals.
The manual will be updated as new releases are issued and as needed to
provide further information on advancements or modifications to the
software.</p>

<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://nwtc.nrel.gov/SubDyn">SubDyn</a> is a time-domain
structural-dynamics module for multimember fixed-bottom substructures
created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) through U.S.
Department of Energy Wind and Water Power Program support. The module
has been coupled into the FAST aero-hydro-servo-elastic computer-aided
engineering (CAE) tool. Substructure types supported by SubDyn include
monopiles, tripods, jackets, and other non-floating lattice-type
substructures common for offshore wind installations in shallow and
transitional water depths. SubDyn can also be used to model lattice
support structures for land-based wind turbines.</p>
<p>The new SubDyn module follows the requirements of the FAST
modularization framework, couples to
<a class="reference external" href="http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/fast8/">OpenFAST</a>, and
provides new capabilities (relative to prior released versions of the
software) for modeling the dynamic loading on multimember substructures.
(Refer to Appendix E and the <em>changelog.txt</em> file that is provided in
the archives for more details about changes among different versions.)
SubDyn can also be driven as a standalone code to compute the mode
shapes, natural frequencies, and time-domain responses of substructures
under prescribed motion at the interface to the tower, uncoupled from
FAST and in the absence of external loading other than gravity.</p>
<p>SubDyn relies on two main engineering schematizations: (1) a linear
frame finite-element beam model (LFEB), and (2) a dynamics system
reduction via the Craig-Bampton(C-B) method, together with a
static-improvement method (SIM), greatly reducing the number of modes
needed to obtain an accurate solution. More details can be found in
Section 6, and in :cite:<a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">`</span></a>song2013, damiani2013, damiani13&#8217;.</p>
<p>In SubDyn, the substructure is considered to be either clamped or
supported by springs at the seabed, and rigidly connected to the
transition piece (TP) at the substructure top nodes (interface nodes).
The spring constants are provided by the user to simulate
soil-structure-interaction (SSI). Other restraint formulations may be
implemented in the future. Only the substructure structural dynamics are
intended to be modeled within SubDyn. When integrated with FAST, the
structural dynamics of the TP, tower, and rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA)
are modeled within FAST’s ElastoDyn module and hydrodynamics are modeled
within FAST’s <a class="reference external" href="https://nwtc.nrel.gov/HydroDyn">HydroDyn</a> module. For
full lattice support structures or other structures with no transition
piece, however, the entire support structure up to the yaw bearing may
be modeled within SubDyn. Modeling the tower in SubDyn as opposed to
ElastoDyn, for example, allows for the possibility of including more
than the first two fore-aft and side-to-side bending modes, thus
accounting for more general flexibility of the tower and its segments.
However, for tubular towers, the structural model in ElastoDyn tends to
be more accurate because ElastoDyn considers geometric nonlinearities
not treated in SubDyn.</p>
<p>Loads and responses are transferred between SubDyn, HydroDyn, and
ElastoDyn via the FAST driver program (glue code) to enable
hydro-elastic interaction at each coupling time step. At the interface
nodes, the TP six degree-of-freedom (DOF) displacements (three
translations and three rotations), velocities, and accelerations are
inputs to SubDyn from ElastoDyn; and the six reaction loads at the TP
(three forces and three moments) are outputs from SubDyn to ElastoDyn.
SubDyn also outputs the local substructure displacements, velocities,
and accelerations to HydroDyn in order to calculate the local
hydrodynamic loads that become inputs for SubDyn. In addition, SubDyn
can calculate member internal reaction loads, as requested by the user
(see Figure 1).</p>

</div>
<p>The input file defines the substructure geometry, material properties,
restraints and SSI data files, finite-element resolution, number of
retained modes in the dynamics system reduction, modal damping
coefficients, and auxiliary parameters. The geometry is defined by joint
coordinates in the global reference system (inertial-frame coordinate
system shown in ), with the origin at the intersection of the
undeflected tower centerline with mean sea level (MSL) or ground level
for land-based structures. A member connects two joints; multiple
members may use a common joint. Nodes are the result of the member
refinement into multiple (<strong>*NDiv*</strong> input parameter) elements (nodes
are located at the ends of each element, as shown in ), and they are
calculated by the module.</p>
<p>In the current release, the geometry of a member is defined by its outer
diameter and wall thickness (assuming a tubular geometry), and the
material properties are defined by its Young’s modulus, shear modulus,
and mass density. Member properties are specified at the joints; if
properties change from one joint to the other, they will be linearly
interpolated for the inner elements. Thus, a tapered member will be
treated as a cylindrical member with step-wise variation of its
properties. In a future release, a tapered finite-element formulation
will be implemented, and a more accurate representation of a tapered
member will become available.</p>
<p>The hydrodynamic loads (including buoyancy) are computed by HydroDyn and
transferred by the glue code at those nodes that are underwater
(submerged nodes). Additionally, the self-weight distributed load
components (from gravity) are calculated by SubDyn and applied at all
the nodes. Note that other load and inertial properties may be input via
the HydroDyn module input file, where marine growth and
flooding/ballasting of the members can be specified.</p>
<p>This document is organized as follows. Section 2 details how to obtain
the SubDyn and FAST software archives and run either the stand-alone
version of SubDyn or SubDyn coupled to FAST. Section 3 describes the
SubDyn input files. Section 4 discusses the output files generated by
SubDyn; these include echo files, a summary file, and the results file.
Section 5 provides modeling guidance when using SubDyn. The SubDyn
theory is covered in Section 6. Section outlines future work, and
Section 8 contains a list of references. Example input files are shown
in Appendices A and B. A summary of available output channels are found
in Appendix C. Instructions for compiling the stand-alone SubDyn program
are detailed in Appendix D. Appendix E tracks the major changes that
have been made to SubDyn for each public release.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Running SubDyn</li>
</ol>
<p>This section discusses how to obtain and execute SubDyn from a personal
computer. Both the stand-alone version and the FAST-coupled version of
the software are considered.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Downloading the SubDyn Software TO REDO HIHGLIGHTED SECTIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two forms of the SubDyn software to choose from: stand alone
and coupled to the FAST simulator. Although the user may not necessarily
need both forms, he/she would likely need to be familiar with and run
the stand-alone model if building a model of the substructure from
scratch. The stand-alone version is also helpful for model
troubleshooting and may benefit users who are interested in conducting
aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulations of an offshore wind turbine. For
this reason, SubDyn can be obtained from two different repositories: one
for the stand-alone SubDyn and one for the coupled solution through
FAST.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Stand-Alone SubDyn Archive</li>
</ol>
<p>Users can download the stand-alone SubDyn archive from our Web server at
<a class="reference external" href="https://nwtc.nrel.gov/SubDyn">*https://nwtc.nrel.gov/SubDyn*</a>. The
file has a name similar to <em>SD_v1.03.00a-rrd.exe</em>, but may have a
different version number. The user can then download the self-extracting
archive (.exe) to expand the archive into a folder he/she specifies.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="html\media/image148.png"><img alt="image2" src="html\media/image148.png" style="width: 3.31482in; height: 2.19381in;" /></a></p>
<p>Figure 2. WinZip Self-Extractor main window TO REPLACE WITH CURRENT
ARCHIVE METHODS ETC.</p>
<p>The archive contains the <strong>*bin*</strong>, <strong>*CertTest*</strong>, <strong>*Compiling*</strong>,
<strong>*Documentation*</strong>, and <strong>*Source*</strong> folders. The <strong>*bin*</strong> folder
includes the main executable file, <em>SubDyn_win32.exe</em>, which is used to
execute the stand-alone SubDyn program. The <strong>*CertTest*</strong> folder
contains a collection of sample SubDyn input files and driver input
files that can be used as templates for the user’s own models. If the
user runs the <em>CertTest.bat</em> DOS script, he/she can compare the results
to the ones stored in the <strong>*NREL_Results*</strong> subfolder. This manual may
be found in the <strong>*Documentation*</strong> folder. The <strong>*Compiling*</strong> folder
contains files for compiling the stand-alone <em>SubDyn_win32.exe</em> file
with either Visual Studio or gFortran. The Fortran source code is
located in the <strong>*Source*</strong> folder.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>FAST Archive</li>
</ol>
<p>Download the FAST archive, which includes a coupling to SubDyn, from our
Web server at <a class="reference external" href="https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST8">https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST8</a>. The file has a name similar
to <em>FAST_v8.08.00.exe</em>, but may have a different version number. Run
the downloaded self-extracting archive (<em>.exe</em>) to expand the archive
into a user-specified folder. The FAST executable file is located in the
archive’s <strong>*bin*</strong> folder. Example models using the NREL 5-MW reference
turbine and various substructures are located in the <strong>*CertTest*</strong>
folder. These include Test19: OC3-Monopile, Test20: OC3-Tripod, Test21:
OC4-jacket.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The stand-alone SubDyn program, <em>SubDyn_win32.exe</em>, simulates
substructure dynamic responses of the user’s input model, without
coupling to FAST. Unlike the coupled version, the stand-alone software
requires the use of a driver file in addition to the primary SubDyn
input file. This driver file specifies inputs normally provided to
SubDyn by FAST, including motions of the TP reference point. Both the
SubDyn summary file and the results output file are available when using
the stand-alone SubDyn (see Section 4 for more information regarding the
SubDyn output files).</p>
<p>Run the standalone SubDyn software from a DOS command prompt by typing,
for example:</p>
<p>&gt;SubDyn_win32.exe MyDriverFile.dvr</p>
<p>where, <em>MyDriverFile.dvr</em> is the name of the SubDyn driver file, as
described in Section 3.2. The SubDyn primary input file is described in
Section 3.3.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Running SubDyn Coupled to FAST</li>
</ol>
<p>Run the coupled FAST software from a DOS command prompt by typing, for
example:</p>
<p>&gt;FAST_win32.exe Test21.fst</p>
<p>where, <em>Test21.fst</em> is the name of the primary FAST input file. This
input file has a feature switch to enable or disable the SubDyn
capabilities within FAST, and a corresponding reference to the SubDyn
input file. See the documentation supplied with FAST for further
information.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Input Files</li>
</ol>
<p>The user specifies the substructure model parameters, including its
geometry and properties, via a primary SubDyn input file. When used in
stand-alone mode, an additional driver input file is required. This
driver file specifies inputs normally provided to SubDyn by FAST,
including motions of the TP reference point.</p>
<p>No lines should be added or removed from the input files, except in
tables where the number of rows is specified.</p>
<p>Additional input files containing soil-structure information (<em>SSIfile</em>)
can be provided by the user specifying their paths in the main SubDyn
input file under the section titled <em>BASE REACTION JOINTS</em>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Units</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn uses the SI system (kg, m, s, N). Angles are assumed to be in
radians unless otherwise specified.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>SubDyn Driver Input File</li>
</ol>
<p>The driver input file is only needed for the stand-alone version of
SubDyn and contains inputs that are normally set by FAST, and that are
necessary to control the simulation for uncoupled models. It is possible
to provide per-time-step inputs to SubDyn, even in stand-alone mode, by
tying the driver file to an additional input file containing
time-histories of the TP motion (displacements, velocities, and
accelerations). A sample SubDyn driver input file is given in Appendix
B.</p>
<p>Users can set the <strong>*Echo*</strong> flag in this file to TRUE so that
<em>SubDyn_win32.exe</em> echoes the contents of the driver input file (useful
for debugging errors in the driver file). The echo file has the naming
convention of <strong>*OutRootName</strong>.dvr.ech*. <strong>*OutRootName*</strong> is specified
in the SUBDYN section of the driver input file (see below).</p>
<p>Set the gravity constant using the <strong>*Gravity*</strong> parameter. SubDyn
expects a magnitude, so in SI units this would be set to 9.80665
<span class="math">\(\frac{m}{s^{2}}\)</span> for standard gravity. <strong>*WtrDpth*</strong> specifies
the water depth (depth of the seabed), based on the reference MSL, and
must be a value greater than zero.</p>
<p><strong>*SDInputFile*</strong> is the file name of the primary SubDyn input file.
This name should be in quotations and can contain an absolute path or a
relative path. All SubDyn-generated output files will be prefixed with
<strong>*OutRootName*</strong>. If this parameter includes a file path, the output
will be generated in that folder. <strong>*NSteps*</strong> specifies the number of
simulation time steps, and <strong>*TimeStep*</strong> specifies the time between
steps. Next, the user must specify the location of the TP reference
point <strong>*TP_RefPoint*</strong> (in the global reference system). This is
normally set by FAST through the ElastoDyn input file, and it is the
so-called <em>platform</em> reference point location. When coupled to FAST, the
<em>platform</em> reference point location is identified by only one (<em>Z</em>)
coordinate. The interface joints, defined in SubDyn’s main input file,
are rigidly connected to this reference point. To utilize the same
geometry definition within SubDyn’s main input file, while still
allowing for different substructure orientations about the vertical, the
user can set <strong>*SubRotateZ*</strong> to a prescribed angle in degrees with
respect to the global <em>Z</em>-axis. The entire substructure will be rotated
by that angle. (This feature is only available in stand-alone mode.)</p>
<p>Setting <strong>*InputsMod*</strong> = 0 sets all TP reference-point input motions to
zero for all time steps. Setting <strong>*InputsMod*</strong> = 1 allows the user to
provide steady (fixed) inputs for the TP motion in the STEADY INPUTS
section of the file—<strong>*uTPInSteady*</strong>, <strong>*uDotTPInSteady*</strong>, and
<strong>*uDotDotTPInSteady*</strong> following the same convention as Table 1
(without time). Setting <strong>*InputsMod*</strong> = 2 allows the user to input a
time-series file whose name is specified via the <strong>*InputsFile*</strong>
parameter. The time-series input file is a text-formatted file. This
file has no header lines, <strong>*NSteps*</strong> rows, and each <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> row
has the first column showing time as <em>t</em> = ( <em>i</em> – 1 )*<strong>*TimeStep*</strong>
(the data will not be interpolated to other times). The remainder of
each row is made of white-space-separated columns of floating point
values representing the necessary motion inputs as shown in Table 1. All
motions are specified in the global, inertial-frame coordinate system.
SubDyn does not check for physical consistency between the displacement,
velocity, and acceleration motions specified for the TP reference point
in the driver file.</p>

<li>SubDyn Primary Input File</li>
</ol>
<p>The SubDyn input file defines the substructure geometry, integration and
simulation options, finite-element parameters, and output channels. The
geometry of members is defined by joint coordinates of the undisplaced
substructure in the global reference system (inertial-frame coordinate
system), with the origin at the intersection of the undeflected tower
centerline with MSL or ground level for land-based structures. A member
connects two joints; multiple members can use a common joint. The
hydrodynamic and gravity loads are applied at the nodes, which are the
resultant of member refinement into multiple (<strong>*NDiv*</strong> input) elements
(nodes are located at the ends of each element), as calculated by the
module. Member properties include outer diameter, thickness, material
density, and Young’s and shear moduli. Member properties are specified
at the joints; if properties change from one joint to the other, they
will be linearly interpolated for the inner nodes. Unlike the geometric
properties, the material properties are not allowed to change within a
single member.</p>
<p>Future releases will allow for members of different cross-sections,
i.e., noncircular members. For this reason, the input file has
(currently unused) sections dedicated to the identification of direction
cosines that in the future will allow the module to identify the correct
orientation of noncircular members. The current release only accepts
tubular (circular) members.</p>
<p>The file is organized into several functional sections. Each section
corresponds to an aspect of the SubDyn model and substructure.</p>
<p>If this manual refers to an ID in a table entry, it is an integer
identifier for the table entry and must be unique for a given table
entry.</p>
<p>A sample SubDyn primary input file is given in Appendix A.</p>
<p>The input file begins with two lines of header information, which is for
the user but is not used by the software.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Simulation Controls</li>
</ol>
<p>Users can set the <strong>*Echo*</strong> flag to TRUE to have SubDyn echo the
contents of the SubDyn input file (useful for debugging errors in the
input file). The echo file has the naming convention of
<strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.ech*. <strong>*OutRootName*</strong> is either specified in the
SUBDYN section of the driver input file when running SubDyn standalone,
or by FAST, when running a coupled simulation, from FAST’s main input
file.</p>
<p><strong>*SDdeltaT*</strong> specifies the fixed time step of the integration in
seconds. The keyword ‘DEFAULT’ may be used to indicate that the module
should employ the time step prescribed by the driver code
(FAST/standalone driver program).</p>
<p><strong>*IntMethod*</strong> specifies the integration algorithm to use. There are
four options: 1) Runge-Kutta 4<sup>th</sup>-order explicit (RK4); 2)
Adams-Bashforth 4<sup>th</sup>-order explicit predictor (AB4); 3)
Adams-Bashforth-Moulton 4<sup>th</sup>-order explicit predictor-corrector
(ABM4); 4) Adams-Moulton implicit 2<sup>nd</sup>-order (AM2). See Section
on how to properly select this and the previous parameter values.</p>
<p><strong>*SttcSolve*</strong> is a flag that specifies whether SIM (see Sections 5 and
6) shall be employed. Through this method, all (higher frequency) modes
that are not considered by the C-B reduction are treated
quasi-statically (see Section for more details). This treatment helps
minimize the number of retained modes needed to capture effects such as
static gravity and buoyancy loads, and high-frequency loads transferred
from the turbine.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>FEA and Craig-Bampton Parameters</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>*FEMMod*</strong> specifies one of the following options for finite-element
formulation: 1) Euler-Bernoulli; 3) Timoshenko. Tapered formulations (2
and 4) have yet to be implemented and will be available in a future
release.</p>
<p><strong>*NDiv*</strong> specifies the number of elements per member. Analysis nodes
are located at the ends of elements and the number of analysis nodes per
member equals <strong>*NDiv*</strong> + 1. <strong>*NDiv*</strong> is applied uniformly to all
members regardless of the member’s length, hence it could result in
small elements in some members and long elements in other members.
Increasing the number of elements per member may increase accuracy, with
the trade-off of increased memory usage and computation time. We
recommend using <strong>*NDiv*</strong> &gt; 1 when modeling tapered members.</p>
<p><strong>*CBMod*</strong> is a flag that specifies whether or not the C-B reduction
should be carried out by the module. If FALSE, then the full
finite-element model is retained and <strong>*Nmodes*</strong> is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>*Nmodes*</strong> sets the number of internal C-B modal DOFs to retain in the
C-B reduction. <strong>*Nmodes*</strong> = 0 corresponds to a Guyan (static)
reduction. <strong>*Nmodes*</strong> is ignored if <strong>*CBMod*</strong> is set to FALSE,
meaning the full finite-element model is retained by keeping all modes.</p>
<p><strong>*JDampings*</strong> specifies value(s) of damping coefficients as a
percentage of critical damping for the retained C-B modes. Distinct
damping coefficients for each retained mode should be listed on the same
line, separated by white space. If the number of <strong>*JDampings*</strong> is less
than the number of retained modes, the last value will be replicated for
all the remaining modes.</p>
<p>For more information on these parameters and guidelines on how to set
them, see Sections 5 and 6.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Structure Joints</li>
</ol>
<p>The finite-element model is based on a substructure composed of joints
interconnected by members. <strong>*NJoints*</strong> is the user-specified number of
joints, and determines the number of rows in the subsequent table.
Because a member connects two joints, <strong>*NJoints*</strong> must be greater than
or equal to two. Each joint listed in the table is identified by a
unique integer, <strong>*JointID*</strong>; each integer between one and
<strong>*NJoints*</strong> must be present in the table, but they need not be
sequential. The (<em>X</em>,<em>Y</em>,<em>Z</em>) coordinate of each joint is specified
in the substructure (SS) coordinate system, which coincides with the
global inertial-frame coordinate system via <strong>*JointXss*</strong>,
<strong>*JointYss*</strong>, and <strong>*JointZss*</strong>, respectively. This version of SubDyn
does not consider overlap when multiple members meet at a common joint,
therefore, it tends to overestimate the total substructure mass. Member
overlap and node offset calculations will be considered in a future
release of SubDyn.</p>
<p>Note for HydroDyn coupling: modeling a fixed-bottom substructure
embedded into the seabed (e.g., through piles or suction buckets)
requires that the lowest member joint(s) in HydroDyn lie(s) below the
water depth. Placing a joint at or above the water depth will result in
static and dynamic pressure loads being applied at the joint. When
SubDyn is coupled to FAST, the joints and members need not match between
HydroDyn and SubDyn—FAST’s mesh-mapping utility handles transfer of
motion and loads across meshes in a physically relevant manner (Sprague
et al. 2014), but consistency between the joints and members in HydroDyn
and SubDyn is advised.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Base Reaction Joints</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn requires the user to specify the boundary joints. <strong>*NReact*</strong>
should be set equal to the number of joints (defined earlier) at the
bottom of the structure (i.e., seabed) that are fully constrained;
<strong>*NReact*</strong> also determines the number of rows in the subsequent table.
In SubDyn, <strong>*NReact*</strong> must be greater than or equal to one. Each joint
listed in the table is identified by a unique integer, <strong>*RJointID*</strong>,
which must correspond to the <strong>*JointID*</strong> value found in the STRUCTURE
JOINTS table. The flags <strong>*RctTDXss*</strong>, <strong>*RctTDYss*</strong>, <strong>*RctTDZss*</strong>,
<strong>*RctRDXss*</strong>, <strong>*RctRDYss*</strong>, <strong>*RctRDZss*</strong> indicate the fixity value
for the three translations (TD) and three rotations (RD) in the SS
coordinate system (global inertial-frame coordinate system). One denotes
fixed and zero denotes free (instead of TRUE/FALSE). <strong>*SSIfile*</strong>
points to the relative path and filename for an SSI information file.
This version of SubDyn can, in fact, handle partially restrained joints
by setting one or more DOF flags to 0 and providing the appropriate
stiffness and mass matrix elements for that DOF via the <strong>*SSIfile*</strong>.
If a DOF flag is set to 1, then the node DOF is considered restrained
and the associated matrix elements potentially provided in the
<strong>*SSIfile*</strong> will be ignored.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Interface Joints</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn requires the user to specify the interface joints. <strong>*NInterf*</strong>
should be set equal to the number of joints at the top of the structure
(i.e., TP); <strong>*NInterf*</strong> also determines the number of rows in the
subsequent table. In SubDyn, <strong>*NInterf*</strong> must be greater than or equal
to one. Note that these joints will be assumed to be rigidly connected
to the platform reference point of ElastoDyn (see FAST documentation)
when coupled to FAST, or to the TP reference point if SubDyn is run in
stand-alone mode. Each joint listed in the table is identified by a
unique integer, <strong>*IJointID*</strong>, which must correspond to the <em>JointID</em>
value found in the STRUCTURE JOINTS table. The flags <strong>*ItfTDXss*</strong>,
<strong>*ItfTDYss*</strong>, <strong>*ItfTDZss*</strong>, <strong>*ItfRDXss*</strong>, <strong>*ItfRDYss*</strong>,
<strong>*ItfRDZss*</strong> indicate the fixity value for the three translations (TD)
and three rotations (RD) in the SS coordinate system (global
inertial-frame coordinate system). One denotes fixed and zero denotes
free (instead of TRUE/FALSE). This version of SubDyn cannot handle
partially restrained joints, so all flags must be set to one; different
degrees of fixity will be considered in a future release.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Members</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>*NMembers*</strong> is the user-specified number of members and determines
the number of rows in the subsequent table. Each member listed in the
table is identified by a unique integer, <strong>*MemberID*</strong>. Each integer
between one and <strong>*NMembers*</strong> must be present in the table, but they
need not be sequential. For each member distinguished by <strong>*MemberID*</strong>,
<strong>*MJointID1*</strong> specifies the starting joint and <strong>*MJointID2*</strong>
specifies the ending joint, corresponding to an identifier
(<strong>*JointID*</strong>) from the STRUCTURE JOINTS table. Likewise,
<strong>*MPropSetID1*</strong> corresponds to the identifier <strong>*PropSetID*</strong> from the
MEMBER X-SECTION PROPERTY table (discussed next) for starting
cross-section properties and <strong>*MPropSetID2*</strong> specifies the identifier
for ending cross-section properties, allowing for tapered members.
<strong>*COSMID*</strong> refers to the IDs of the members’ cosine matrices for
noncircular members; the current release ignores this column.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Member Cross-Section Properties</li>
</ol>
<p>Members in SubDyn are assumed to be straight, circular, possibly
tapered, and hollow cylinders. Future releases will allow for generic
cross-sections to be employed. These special cross-section members will
be defined in the second of two tables in the input file (Member
X-Section Property data 2/2), which is currently ignored.</p>
<p>For the circular cross-section members, properties needed by SubDyn are
material Young’s modulus, <strong>*YoungE*</strong>, shear modulus, <strong>*ShearG*</strong>, and
density, <strong>*MatDens*</strong>, member outer diameter, <strong>*XsecD*</strong>, and member
thickness, <strong>*XsecT*</strong>. Users will need to create an entry in the first
table within this section of the input file distinguished by
<strong>*PropSetID*</strong>, for each unique combination of these five properties.
The member property-set table contains <strong>*NPropSets*</strong> rows. The member
property sets are referred to by their <strong>*PropSetID*</strong> in the MEMBERS
table, as described in Section . Note, however, that although diameter
and thickness will be linearly interpolated within an individual member,
SubDyn will not allow <em>material</em> properties to change within an
individual member.</p>
<p>The second table in this section of the input file (not to be used in
this release) will have <strong>*NXPropSets*</strong> rows (assumed to be zero for
this release), and have additional entries when compared to the previous
table, including: cross-sectional area (<strong>*XsecA*</strong>), cross-sectional
shear area along the local principal axes <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (<strong>*XsecAsx*</strong>,
<strong>*XsecAsy*</strong>), cross-sectional area second moment of inertia about <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> (<strong>*XsecJxx*</strong>, <strong>*XsecJyy*</strong>), and cross-sectional area polar
moment of inertia (<strong>*XsecJ0*</strong>). The member cosine matrix section (see
Section ) will help determine the correct orientation of the members
within the assembly.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Member Cosine Matrices COSM (i,j)</li>
</ol>
<p>This table is not currently used by SubDyn, but in future releases it
will need to be populated if members with cross-sections other than
circular will be employed.</p>
<p><strong>*NCOSMs*</strong> rows, one for each unique member orientation set, will need
to be provided. Each row of the table will list the nine entries of the
direction cosine matrices (COSM11, COSM12,…COSM33) for matrix elements
(1,1), (1,2),…(3,3) that establish the orientation of the local member
axes (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em> principal axes in the cross-sectional plane, <em>z</em> along
the member longitudinal axis) with respect to the SS coordinate system
(local-to-global transformation matrices).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Joint Additional Concentrated Masses</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn can accept <strong>*NCmass*</strong> lumped masses/inertias defined at the
joints. The subsequent table will have <strong>*NCmass*</strong> rows, in which for
each joint distinguished by <strong>*CMJointID*</strong> (corresponding to an
identifier, <strong>*JointID*</strong>, from the STRUCTURE JOINTS table), <strong>*JMass*</strong>
specifies the lumped mass value, and <strong>*JMXX*</strong>, <strong>*JMYY*</strong>, <strong>*JMZZ*</strong>
specify the mass second moments of inertia with respect to the SS
coordinate system.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Output: Summary and Outfile</li>
</ol>
<p>In this section of the input file, the user sets flags and switches for
the desired output behavior.</p>
<p>Specifying <strong>*SDSum*</strong> = TRUE causes SubDyn to generate a summary file
with name <strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.sum*. <strong>*OutRootName*</strong> is either
specified in the SUBDYN section of the driver input file when running
SubDyn in stand-alone mode, or in the FAST input file when running a
coupled simulation. See Section 4.2 for summary file details.</p>
<p>In this release, <strong>*OutCOSM*</strong> is ignored. In future releases,
specifying <strong>*OutCOSM*</strong> = TRUE will cause SubDyn to include direction
cosine matrices (undeflected) in the summary file for only those members
requested in the list of output channels.</p>
<p>Specifying <strong>*OutAll*</strong> = TRUE causes SubDyn to output forces and
moments at all of the joints (not internal nodes). That is, the static
(elastic) and dynamic (inertia) components of the three forces and three
moments at the end node of each member connected to a given joint are
output for all joints. These outputs are included within the
<strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.out* output file in addition to those directly
specified through the output channels section below.</p>
<p>If <strong>*OutSwtch*</strong> is set to one, outputs are sent to a file with the
name <strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.out*. If <strong>*OutSwtch*</strong> is set to two, outputs
are sent to the calling program (FAST) for writing in its main output
file (not available in stand-alone mode). If <strong>*OutSwtch*</strong> is set to
three, both file outputs occur. In stand-alone mode, setting
<strong>*OutSwtch*</strong> to two results in no output file being produced.</p>
<p>If <strong>*TabDelim*</strong> is set to TRUE and <strong>*OutSwtch*</strong> is set to one, the
output file <strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.out* will be tab-delimited.</p>
<p>With <strong>*OutDec*</strong> set to an integer value greater than one, the output
file data rate will be decimated, and only every <strong>*OutDec*</strong>-th value
will be written to the file. This applies only to SubDyn’s output file
(<strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.out*)—not FAST’s.</p>
<p>The <strong>*OutFmt*</strong> and <strong>*OutSFmt*</strong> parameters control the formatting of
SubDyn’s output file for the output data and the channel headers,
respectively. SubDyn currently does not check the validity of these
format strings. They need to be valid Fortran format strings.
<strong>*OutSFmt*</strong> is used for the column header and <strong>*OutFmt*</strong> is used for
the channel data. Therefore, in order for the headers and channel data
to align properly, the width specification should match. For example:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&#8220;ES11.4&#8221; OutFmt</div>
<div class="line">&#8220;A11&#8221; OutSFmt.</div>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Member Output List</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn can output load and kinematic quantities at up to nine locations
for up to nine different members, for a total of 81 possible local
member output locations. <strong>*NMOutputs*</strong> specifies the number of members
that output is requested for. The user must create a table entry for
each requested member. Within a row of this table, <strong>*MemberID*</strong> is the
ID specified in the MEMBERS table, and <strong>*NOutCnt*</strong> specifies how many
nodes along the member will generate output. <strong>*NodeCnt*</strong> specifies
those node numbers (a separate entry on the same line for each node) for
output as an integer index from the start-joint (node 1) to the
end-joint (node <strong>*NDiv*</strong> + 1) of the member. The outputs specified in
the SDOutList section determines which quantities are actually output at
these locations.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Output Channels- SDOutList Section</li>
</ol>
<p>This section specifies which quantities are output by SubDyn. Enter one
or more lines containing quoted strings that in turn contain one or more
output parameter names. Separate output parameter names by any
combination of commas, semicolons, spaces, and/or tabs. If a parameter
name is prefixed with a minus sign, “-”, underscore, “_”, or the
characters “m” or “M”, SubDyn will multiply the value for that channel
by –1 before writing the data. The parameters are written in the order
they are listed in the input file. SubDyn allows the use of multiple
lines so that users can break their lists into meaningful groups and so
the lines can be shorter. Comments may also be entered after the closing
quote on any of the lines. Entering a line with the string “END” at the
beginning of the line or at the beginning of a quoted string found at
the beginning of the line will cause SubDyn to quit scanning for more
lines of channel names. Modal kinematics and member-node-, base-, and
interface-related kinematic and load quantities can be selected.
Member-node-related data follow the organization described in Section .
If SubDyn encounters an unknown/invalid channel name, it prints an error
message and halts execution. Please refer to Appendix C for a complete
list of possible output parameters and their names.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>SSI Input File</li>
</ol>
<p>Individual SSI files (<em>SSIfiles</em>) can be provided for each restrained
node, therefore the maximum number of SSIfiles is <strong>*NReact*</strong>. In an
SSIfile, up to 21 elements for the SSI mass matrix and up to 21 SSI
stiffness matrix elements can be provided. The mass and stiffness
elements account for both pile and soil effects. No additional damping
can be provided at this point.</p>
<p>The order of the elements is not important, because each element value
is accompanied by a string label that identifies the actual element. The
stiffness matrix accepted labels are: &#8216;Kxx&#8217;, &#8216;Kxy&#8217;, &#8216;Kyy&#8217;, &#8216;Kxz&#8217;, &#8216;Kyz’,
&#8216;Kzz’, &#8216;Kxtx&#8217;, &#8216;Kytx&#8217;, &#8216;Kztx&#8217;, &#8216;Ktxtx&#8217;, &#8216;Kxty&#8217;, &#8216;Kyty&#8217;,&#8217;Kzty’, &#8216;Ktxty&#8217;,
&#8216;Ktyty&#8217;, ‘Kxtz&#8217;, &#8216;Kytz&#8217;, &#8216;Kztz&#8217;, &#8216;Ktxtz&#8217;, &#8216;Ktytz&#8217;, &#8216;Ktztz&#8217;.</p>
<p>If any matrix element is not provided it will be set to infinity (i.e.,
machine ‘huge’) by default.</p>
<p>For the mass matrix the accepted labels are:
&#8216;Mxx&#8217;,&#8217;Mxy&#8217;,&#8217;Myy&#8217;,&#8217;Mxz&#8217;,&#8217;Myz&#8217;, &#8216;Mzz&#8217;,&#8217;Mxtx&#8217;,&#8217;Mytx&#8217;,&#8217;Mztx&#8217;, &#8216;Mtxtx&#8217;,
&#8216;Mxty&#8217;, &#8216;Myty&#8217;, &#8216;Mzty&#8217;, &#8216;Mtxty&#8217;, &#8216;Mtyty&#8217;, &#8216;Mxtz&#8217;, &#8216;Mytz&#8217;, &#8216;Mztz&#8217;,
&#8216;Mtxtz&#8217;, &#8216;Mtytz&#8217;, &#8216;Mtztz&#8217;. If any matrix element is not provided it will
be set to 0 by default. The labels contain ‘K’ or ‘M’ to specify
stiffness or mass matrix elements, and then the directions they apply
to, e.g., ‘Kxy’ refers to the force along x due to a unit displacement
along y; the ‘t’ refers to the rotation about one of the ‘x’,’y’, or ’z’
axes in the global coordinate system.</p>
<p>Units are in SI system (N/m; N/m/rad; Nm/rad, Kg, kgm, kgm2).</p>
<p>Note that by selecting fixities of 1 in the various DOFs of the
restrained nodes, the columns and rows associated with those DOFs will
be removed, therefore the associated matrix elements will be ignored.</p>
<p>A sample SubDyn SSI input file is given in Appendix C.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Output Files</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn produces three types of output files: an echo file, a summary
file, and a time-series results file. The following sections detail the
purpose and contents of these files.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Echo Files</li>
</ol>
<p>If the user sets the <strong>*Echo*</strong> flag to TRUE in the SubDyn driver file
or the primary SubDyn input file, the contents of those files will be
echoed to a file with the naming conventions, <strong>*OutRootName</strong>.dvr.ech*
for the driver input file and <strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.ech* for the primary
SubDyn input file. <strong>*OutRootName*</strong> is either specified in the SUBDYN
section of the driver input file, or in the FAST input file. The echo
files are helpful for debugging the input files. The contents of an echo
file will be truncated if SubDyn encounters an error while parsing an
input file. The error usually corresponds to the line after the last
successfully echoed line.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Summary File</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn generates a summary file with the naming convention,
<strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.sum* if the <strong>*SDSum*</strong> parameter is set to TRUE.
This file summarizes key information about the substructure model,
including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Undisplaced node geometry: a list of all of the (<strong>*NNodes*</strong>) nodes
and the <em>X</em>,<em>Y</em>,<em>Z</em> coordinates in the global SS coordinate
system. Note that <strong>*NNodes*</strong> may be greater or equal to
<strong>*NJoints*</strong>, depending on <strong>*NDiv*</strong> (primary input file
parameters).</li>
<li>Element connectivity and properties at end nodes: a list of all
(<strong>*NElems*</strong>) elements, the start and end nodes (<strong>*Node_I*</strong>,
<strong>*Node_J*</strong>) and the ID of the property set (<strong>*Prop_I*</strong>,
<strong>*Prop_J*</strong>) at the start and end nodes. <strong>*NElems*</strong> may be
greater or equal to <strong>*NMembers*</strong>, depending on <strong>*NDiv*</strong> (primary
input file parameters).</li>
<li>Property sets. If tapered members are used, additional property sets
may be included beyond those specified in the main input file, based
on interpolated diameter and thickness values. Headers and their
meanings are identical to those described in Section .</li>
<li>Reaction DOFs and interface DOFs and their associated fixity; the
actual indices of the DOFs (<strong>*DOF_ID*</strong>) associated with reaction
and interface nodes are listed together with the (1/0) flag to
distinguish the fixity level.</li>
<li>Concentrated mass schedule. This is an echo of the equivalent section
in the primary input file. Refer to Section .</li>
<li>Member schedule including connectivity to joints, nodes, and their
masses. A table lists all of the members by identifier
(<strong>*MemberID*</strong>), with their start and end nodes (<strong>*Joint1_ID*</strong>,
<strong>*Joint2_ID*</strong>), associated mass (<strong>*Mass*</strong>), and list of node
identifiers along the length of the members.</li>
<li>Direction cosine matrices for the members. Each row (columns 2-10)
corresponds to the direction cosine matrix entries (<strong>*DC(1,1)*</strong>
through <strong>*DC(3,3)*</strong>) for the member whose identifier is listed in
the first column. The direction cosine matrices specify the
transformation from the global reference to the local coordinate
system for each member.</li>
<li>Sorted eigenfrequencies [in Hertz (Hz)] for the full substructural
system (neglecting a possible coupling to ElastoDyn through FAST),
assuming the TP reference point is a free end. There are a total of
<strong>*NDOFs*</strong> eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors.</li>
<li>Sorted eigenfrequencies (in Hz) for the C-B reduced system, assuming
the TP reference point is a fixed end. There are a total of
<strong>*Nmodes*</strong> C-B reduced eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors.</li>
<li>Full substructural system eigenvectors. Each column represents an
eigenvector associated with the corresponding eigenfrequency
identified previously in the file.</li>
<li>C-B reduced system eigenvectors (<strong>*PhiM*</strong> matrix). Each column
represents an eigenvector associated with the corresponding
eigenfrequency identified previously in the file.</li>
<li><strong>*PhiR*</strong> matrix or displacements of the internal nodes caused by
unit rigid body motions of the interface DOFs (see Section ). Each
column of the matrix represents the internal DOF displacements for a
given unit rigid-body motion along an interface DOF for each base and
interface joint.</li>
<li>Substructure equivalent stiffness and mass matrices referred to the
TP reference point (<strong>*KBBt*</strong> and <strong>*MBBt*</strong>), based on a Guyan
reduction. These are useful to calculate effects of substructure
flexibility while calculating tower eigenmodes for ElastoDyn.</li>
<li>Rigid-body-equivalent mass matrix relative to global origin
(<strong>*MRB*</strong>); a 6x6 mass matrix.</li>
<li>Substructure total (dry) mass.</li>
<li>Substructure center of mass coordinates in the global coordinate
system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The various sections of the summary file and variables are
self-explanatory and easily identifiable in the file.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Results File</li>
</ol>
<p>The SubDyn time-series results are written to a text-based file with the
naming convention <strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.out* when <strong>*OutSwtch*</strong> is set to
either one or three. If SubDyn is coupled to FAST and <strong>*OutSwtch*</strong> is
set to two or three, then FAST will generate a master results file that
includes the SubDyn results. The results in <strong>*OutRootName</strong>.SD.out* are
in table format, where each column is a data channel (the first column
always being the simulation time), and each row corresponds to a
simulation time step. The data channels are specified in the SDOutList
section of the input file. The column format of the SubDyn-generated
file is specified using the <strong>*OutFmt*</strong> and <strong>*OutSFmt*</strong> parameters of
the input file.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Modeling Considerations</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn was designed as a flexible tool for modeling a wide range of
substructures for both land-based and offshore applications. This
section provides some general guidance to help construct models that are
compatible with SubDyn.</p>
<p>Please refer to the theory in Section 6 for detailed information about
SubDyn’s coordinate systems, and the theoretical approach we have
followed in SubDyn.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Model Discretization</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn allows for the specification of arbitrary multimember structure
geometries. The user defines the geometry of a structure in SubDyn using
joints and members. Specifically, the user specifies a list of joints
that represent the endpoints of beams, and the connectivity between one
or more members at each joint. Members and their cross-sectional
properties are then defined between two joints. Members can be further
subdivided into multiple (<strong>*NDiv*</strong>) elements to increase the model
resolution. Nodes, where the numerical calculations take place, are
located at the endpoints of each element. To keep the mesh as uniform as
possible when using <strong>*NDiv*</strong>, the initial member definition should
also have a roughly uniform mesh. For tapered members, we recommend
setting <strong>*NDiv*</strong> &gt; 1. Improper discretization of the members may
decrease the accuracy of the model.</p>
<p>When SubDyn is coupled to FAST, the joints and members need not match
between HydroDyn and SubDyn—FAST’s mesh-mapping utility handles the
transfer of motion and loads across meshes in a physically relevant
manner (Sprague et al. 2014), but consistency between the joints and
members in HydroDyn and SubDyn is advised.</p>
<p>For offshore applications, because of the exponential decay of
hydrodynamic loads with depth, HydroDyn requires higher resolution near
the water free surface to properly capture loads as waves oscillate
about the still water level (SWL). We recommend that the HydroDyn
discretization not exceed element lengths of 0.5 m in the region of the
free surface (5 to 10 m above and below SWL), 1.0 m between 25- and 50-m
depth, and 2.0 m in deeper waters.</p>
<p>When SubDyn is hydro-elastically coupled to HydroDyn through FAST for
the analysis of fixed-bottom offshore systems, we recommend that the
length ratio between elements of SubDyn and HydroDyn not exceed 10 to 1.
As such, we recommend that the SubDyn discretization not exceed element
lengths of 5 m in the region of the free surface, 10 m down to 25- to
50-m depth, and 20 m in deeper waters. These are not absolute rules, but
rather a good starting point that will likely require refinement for a
given substructure. Additional considerations for SubDyn discretization
include aspects that will impact structural accuracy, such as member
weight, substructure modes and/or natural frequencies, load transfer,
tapered members, and so on.</p>
<p>Members in SubDyn are assumed to be straight circular (and possibly
tapered) cylinders. The use of more generic cross-sectional shapes will
be considered in a future release.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Foundations</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two methods that can be used to model foundation flexibility
or soil-structure interaction in SubDyn. The first method makes us of
the SSI stiffness and mass matrices at the partially restrained bottom
joints as described in Sections 3.3.4, 3.4, and 6. The second method
mimics the flexibility of the foundation through the apparent (or
effective) fixity (AF) length approach, which idealizes a pile as a
cantilever beam that has properties that are different above and below
the mudline. The beam above the mudline should have the real properties
(i.e., diameter, thickness, and material) of the pile. The beam below
the mudline is specified with effective properties and a fictive length
(i.e., the distance from the mudline to the cantilevered base) that are
tuned to ensure that the overall response of the pile above the mudline
is the same as the reality. The response can only be identical under a
particular set of conditions; however, it is common for the properties
of the fictive beam to be tuned so that the mudline displacement and
rotation would be realistic when loaded by a mudline shear force and
bending moment that are representative of the loading that exists when
the offshore wind turbine is operating under normal conditions.</p>
<p>Note that in HydroDyn, all members that are embedded into the seabed
(e.g., through piles or suction buckets) must have a joint that is
located below the water depth. In SubDyn, the bottom joint(s) will be
considered clamped or partially restrained and therefore need not be
located below the seabed when not applying the AF approach. For example,
if the water depth is set to 20 m, and the user is modeling a
fixed-bottom monopile with a rigid foundation, then the bottom-most
joint in SubDyn can be set at <em>Z</em> = -20 m; HydroDyn, however, needs to
have a Z-coordinate such that <em>Z</em> &lt; -20 m. This configuration avoids
HydroDyn applying static and dynamic pressure loads from the water on
the bottom of the structure. When the AF approach is applied, the
bottom-most joint in SubDyn should be set at <em>Z</em> &lt; -20 m.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Member Overlap</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the current version of SubDyn is incapable of
treating the overlap of members at the joints, resulting in an
overestimate of the mass and potentially of the structure stiffness. One
strategy to overcome this shortcoming employs virtual members to
simulate the portion of each member within the overlap at a joint. The
virtual members should be characterized by low self-mass and high
stiffness. This can be achieved by introducing virtual joints at the
approximate intersection of the finite-sized members, and then
specifying additional members from these new joints to the original
(centerline) joints. The new virtual members then use reduced material
density and increased Young’s and shear moduli. Care is advised in the
choice of these parameters as they may render the system matrix
singular. Inspection of the eigenvalue results in the summary file
should confirm whether acceptable approximations have been achieved.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Substructure Tower/Turbine Coupling</li>
</ol>
<p>When SubDyn is coupled to FAST, the 6 DOFs of the platform in ElastoDyn
must be enabled to couple loads and displacements between the turbine
and the substructure. The platform reference-point coordinates in
ElastoDyn should also be set equal to the TP reference-point’s
coordinates (commonly indicating either the tower-base flange location,
or TP centroid, or TP center of mass) that the user may have set in the
stand-alone mode for checking the SubDyn model. A rigid connection
between the SubDyn interface joints and TP reference point (? platform
reference point) is assumed.</p>
<p>For full lattice support structures or other structures with no
transition piece, the entire support structure up to the yaw bearing may
be modeled within SubDyn. Modeling the tower in SubDyn as opposed to
ElastoDyn, for example, allows the ability to include more than the
first two fore-aft and side-to-side bending modes, thus accounting for
more general flexibility of the tower and its segments; however, for
tubular towers, the structural model in ElastoDyn tends to be more
accurate because ElastoDyn considers geometric nonlinearities not
treated in SubDyn. When modeling full-lattice towers using SubDyn, the
platform reference point in ElastoDyn can be located at the yaw bearing;
in this case, the tower-bending DOFs in ElastoDyn should be disabled.</p>
<p>If FAST is run with SubDyn but not HydroDyn, the water depth will be
automatically set to 0 m. This will influence the calculation of the
reaction loads. Reactions are always provided at the assumed mudline,
therefore, they would not be correctly located for an offshore turbine
as a result. Thus, it is recommended that HydroDyn always be enabled
when modeling bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines.</p>
<p>ElastoDyn also needs tower mode shapes specified (coefficients of
best-fit sixth-order polynomials), derived using appropriate tower-base
boundary conditions. They can be derived with an appropriate software
(finite-element analysis, energy methods, or analytically) and by making
use of the SubDyn-derived equivalent substructure stiffness and mass
matrices (the <em>KBBt</em>/ and <em>MBBt</em>/ matrices found in the SubDyn summary
file) to prescribe the boundary conditions at the base of the tower.</p>
<p>For instance, using NREL’s BModes software, the SubDyn-obtained matrices
can be used in place of the hydrodynamic stiffness (<em>hydro_K</em>) and mass
matrices (<em>hydro_M)</em> (<strong>*mooring_K*</strong> can be set to zero). By setting
the <em>hub_conn</em> boundary condition to two (free-free), BModes will
calculate the mode shapes of the tower when tower cross-sectional
properties are supplied. To obtain eigenmodes that are compatible with
the FAST modal treatment of the tower (i.e., no axial or torsional modes
and no distributed rotational-inertia contribution to the eigenmodes),
the tower-distributed properties should be modified accordingly in
BModes (e.g., by reducing mass moments of inertia towards zero and by
increasing torsional and axial stiffness while assuring convergence of
the results; see also
<a class="reference external" href="https://wind.nrel.gov/forum/wind/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=742">**https://wind.nrel.gov/forum/wind/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=742**</a>).</p>
<p>The rotational inertia of the undeflected tower about its centerline is
not currently accounted for in ElastoDyn. Thus, when the nacelle-yaw DOF
is enabled in ElastoDyn there will not be any rotational inertia of the
platform-yaw DOF (which rotates the tower about its centerline) when
both the platform-yaw inertia in ElastoDyn is zero and the tower is
undeflected. To avoid a potential division-by-zero error in ElastoDyn
when coupled to SubDyn, we recommend setting the platform-yaw inertia
(<strong>*PtfmYIner*</strong>) in ElastoDyn equal to the total rotational inertia of
the undeflected tower about its centerline. Note that the platform mass
and inertia in ElastoDyn can be used to model heavy and rigid transition
pieces that one would not want to model as a flexible body in either the
ElastoDyn tower or SubDyn substructure models.</p>
<p>The C-B method assumes no damping for the interface modes. This is
equivalent to having six undamped rigid-body DOFs at the TP reference
point in the absence of aerodynamic or hydrodynamic damping. Experience
has shown that negligible platform-heave damping can cause numerical
problems when SubDyn is coupled to FAST. One way to overcome this
problem is to augment overall system damping with an additional linear
damping for the platform-heave DOF. This augmentation can be achieved
quite easily by calculating the damping from Eq. (1) and specifying this
as the (3,3) element of HydroDyn’s additional linear damping matrix,
<strong>*AddBLin*</strong>. Experience has shown that a damping ratio of 1% of
critical () is sufficient. In Eq. (1), is the equivalent heave stiffness
of the substructure (the (3,3) element of the <strong>*KBBt*</strong> (i.e.,) matrix
found in the SubDyn summary file, see also Section 6), is the equivalent
heave mass of the substructure (the (3,3) element of the <strong>*MBBt*</strong>
(i.e., ) matrix found in the SubDyn summary file, see also Section 6),
and is the total mass of the rotor, nacelle, tower, and TP (found in the
ElastoDyn summary file).</p>
<p>To minimize extraneous excitation of the platform-heave DOF, it is
useful to set the initial platform-heave displacement to its natural
static-equilibrium position, which can be approximated by Eq. (2), where
is the magnitude of gravity. <em>PtfmHeave</em> from Eq. (2) should be
specified in the initial conditions section of the ElastoDyn input file.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Self-Weight Calculations</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn will calculate the self-weight of the members and apply
appropriate forces and moments at the element nodes. Lumped masses will
also be considered as concentrated gravity loads at prescribed joints.
The array of self-weight forces can be seen in the summary file if the
code is compiled with DEBUG compiler directives. In general, SubDyn
assumes that structural motions of the substructure are small, such that
(1) small-angle assumptions apply to structural rotations and (2) the
so-called P-? effect is negligible, and therefore undeflected node
locations are used for self-weight calculations.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Note On Other Load Calculations</li>
</ol>
<p>When SubDyn is coupled to HydroDyn through FAST, the hydrodynamic loads,
which include buoyancy, marine-growth weight, and wave and current
loads, will be applied to the effective, deflected location of the nodes
by the mesh-mapping routines in the glue code. Those loads, however, are
based on wave kinematics at the undeflected position (see Jonkman et al.
2014 for more information).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Craig-Bampton Guidelines</li>
</ol>
<p>When SubDyn is coupled with FAST, it is important to choose a sufficient
number of C-B modes, ensuring that the vibrational modes of the coupled
system are properly captured by the coupled model. We recommend that all
modes up to at least 2-3 Hz be captured; wind, wave, and turbine
excitations are important for frequencies up to 2-3 Hz. Eigenanalysis of
the linearized, coupled system will make checking this condition
possible and aid in the selection of the number of retained modes;
however, the linearization process has yet to be implemented in FAST v8.
Until full-system linearization is made available, experience has shown
that it is sufficient to enable all C-B modes up to 10 Hz (the natural
frequencies of the C-B modes are written to the SubDyn summary file). If
SIM (see Section ) is not enabled, in addition to capturing physical
modes up to a given frequency, the highest C-B mode must include the
substructure axial modes so that gravity loading from self-weight is
properly accounted for within SubDyn. This inclusion likely requires
enabling a high number of C-B modes, reducing the benefit of the C-B
reduction. Thus, we recommend employing the C-B reduction with SIM
enabled. Because of the fixed-fixed treatment of the substructure
boundary conditions in the C-B reduction, the C-B modes will always have
higher natural frequencies than the physical modes.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Integration Time Step Guidelines</li>
</ol>
<p>Another consideration when creating SubDyn input files is the time step
size. SubDyn offers three explicit time-integrators—the fourth-order
Runge-Kutta (RK4), fourth-order Adams-Bashforth (AB4), fourth-order
Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (ABM4) methods—and the implicit second-order
Adams-Moulton (AM2) method. Users have the option of using the global
time step from the glue code or an alternative SubDyn-unique time step
that is an integer multiple smaller than the glue-code time step<strong>.</strong>
It is essential that a small enough time step is used to ensure solution
accuracy (by providing a sufficient sampling rate to characterize all
key frequencies of the system), numerical stability of the selected
explicit time-integrator, and that the coupling with FAST is numerically
stable.</p>
<p>For the RK4 and ABM4 methods, we recommend that the SubDyn time step
follow the relationship shown in Eq. (3), where is the higher of (1) the
highest natural frequency of the retained C-B modes and (2) the highest
natural frequency of the physical modes when coupled to FAST. Although
the former can be obtained from the SubDyn summary file, the latter is
hard to estimate before the full-system linearization of the coupled
FAST model is realized. Until then, experience has shown that the
highest physical mode when SubDyn is coupled to FAST is often the
platform-heave mode of ElastoDyn, with a frequency given by Eq. (4),
where the variables are defined in Section 5.3.</p>
<p>For the AB4 method, the recommended time step is half the value given by
Eq. (3).</p>
<p>For AM2, being implicit, the required time step is not driven by natural
frequencies within SubDyn, but should still be chosen to ensure solution
accuracy and that the coupling to FAST is numerically stable.</p>

<li>SubDyn Theory<ol class="arabic">
<li>Overview</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This section focuses on the theory behind the SubDyn module.</p>
<p>SubDyn relies on two main engineering approaches: (1) a linear frame
finite-element beam model (LFEB), and (2) a dynamics system reduction
via the Craig-Bampton (C-B) method together with a static-improvement
method (SIM), greatly reducing the number of modes needed to obtain an
accurate solution.</p>
<p>There are many nonlinearities present in offshore wind substructure
models, including material nonlinearity, axial shortening caused by
bending, large displacements, and so on. The material nonlinearity is
not considered here because most offshore multimember support structures
are designed to use steel and the maximum stress is intended to be below
the yield strength of the material. Damiani et al. (2013) demonstrate
that a linear finite-element method is suitable when analyzing wind
turbine substructures. In this work, several wind turbine configurations
that varied in base geometry, load paths, sizes, supported towers, and
turbine masses were analyzed under extreme loads using nonlinear and
linear models. The results revealed that the nonlinear behavior was
mainly caused by the mono-tower response and had little effect on the
multimember support structures. Therefore, an LFEB model for the
substructure is considered appropriate for wind turbine substructures.
The LFEB can accommodate different element types, including
Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam elements of either constant or
longitudinally tapered cross sections (Timoshenko beam elements account
for shear deformation and are better suited to represent low aspect
ratio beams that may be used within frames and to transfer the loads
within the frame).</p>
<p>The large number of DOFs (~10:sup:<cite>3</cite>) associated with a standard
finite-element analysis of a typical multimember structure would hamper
computational efficiency during wind turbine system dynamic simulations.
As a result, the C-B system reduction was implemented to speed up
processing time while retaining a high level of fidelity in the overall
system response. The C-B reduction is used to recharacterize the
substructure finite-element model into a reduced DOF model that
maintains the fundamental low-frequency response modes of the structure.
In the SubDyn initialization step, the large substructure physical DOFs
(displacements) are reduced to a small number of modal DOFs and
interface (boundary) DOFs, and during each time step, only the equations
of motion of these DOFs need to be solved. SubDyn only solves the
equations of motion for the modal DOFs, the motion of the interface
(boundary) DOFs are either prescribed when running SubDyn in stand-alone
mode or solved through equations of motion in ElastoDyn when SubDyn is
coupled to FAST.</p>
<p>Retaining just a few DOFs may, however, lead to the exclusion of axial
modes (normally of very high frequencies), which are important to
capture static load effects, such as those caused by gravity and
buoyancy. The so-called SIM was implemented to mitigate this problem.
SIM computes two static solutions at each time step: one based on the
full system stiffness matrix and one based on the C-B reduced stiffness
matrix. At each time step the time-varying, C-B based, dynamic solution
is superimposed on the difference between the two static solutions,
which amounts to quasi-statically accounting for the contribution of
those modes not directly included within the dynamic solution.</p>
<p>In SubDyn, the substructure is considered to be clamped, or connected
via linear spring-like elements, at the bottom nodes (normally at the
seabed) and rigidly connected to the TP at the substructure top nodes
(interface nodes). The user can provide 6x6, equivalent stiffness and
mass matrices for each of the bottom nodes to account for soil-pile
interaction. As described in other sections of this document, the input
file defines the substructure geometry, material properties, and
constraints. Users can define: element types; full finite-element mode
or C-B reduction; the number of modes to be retained in the C-B
reduction; modal damping coefficients; whether to take advantage of SIM;
and the number of elements for each member.</p>
<p>The following sections discuss the integration of SubDyn within the FAST
framework, the main coordinate systems used in the module, and the
theory pertaining to the LFEB, the C-B reduction, and SIM. The
state-space formulations to be used in the time-domain simulation are
also presented. The last section discusses the calculation of the base
reaction calculation. For further details, see also Song et al. (2013).</p>

<li>Integration with the FAST Modularization Framework</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on a new modularization framework (Jonkman 2013), FAST joins an
aerodynamics module, a hydrodynamics module, a control and electrical
system (servo) module, and structural-dynamics (elastic) modules to
enable coupled nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic analysis of land-based
and offshore wind turbines in the time domain. Figure 3 shows the basic
layout of the SubDyn module within the FAST modularization framework.</p>

<p>Figure 3. SubDyn layout within the modularization framework</p>
<p>In the existing loosely coupled time-integration scheme, the glue-code
transfers data at each time step. Such data includes hydrodynamic loads,
substructure response, loads transmitted to the TP, and TP response
among SubDyn, HydroDyn, and ElastoDyn. At the interface nodes, the TP
displacement, rotation, velocity, and acceleration are inputs to SubDyn
from ElastoDyn, and the reaction forces at the TP are outputs of SubDyn
for input to ElastoDyn. SubDyn also outputs the substructure
displacements, velocities, and accelerations for input to HydroDyn to
calculate the hydrodynamic loads that become inputs for SubDyn. In
addition, SubDyn can calculate the member forces, as requested by the
user. Within this scheme, SubDyn tracks its states and integrates its
equations through its own solver.</p>
<p>In a tightly coupled time-integration scheme (yet to be implemented),
SubDyn sets up its own equations, but its states and those of other
modules are tracked and integrated by a solver within the glue-code that
is common to all of the modules.</p>
<p>SubDyn is implemented in a state-space formulation that forms the
equation of motion of the substructure system with physical DOFs at the
boundaries and modal DOFs representing all interior motions. At each
time step, loads and motions are exchanged between modules through the
driver code; the modal responses are calculated inside SubDyn’s
state-space model; and the next time-step responses are calculated by
the SubDyn integrator for loose coupling and the global system
integrator for tight coupling.</p>

<li>Local to Global Transformation</li>
</ol>
<p>The transformation from local to global coordinate system can be
expressed by the following equation:</p>
<p>where is a generic vector in the local coordinate system, andthe same
vector but in the global coordinate system; and is the direction cosine
matrix of the member axes and can be obtained as follows:</p>

<p>In the current SubDyn release, the transpose (global to local) of these
direction cosine matrices for each member is returned in the summary
file. Given the circular shape of the member cross sections, the
direction cosine matrices have little importance on the member load
verification. To verify joints following the standards (e.g., ISO 19902,
API RP-2A), however, the bending moments need to be decomposed into
in-plane and out-of-plane components, where the plane is that defined by
either a pair of braces (for an X-joint), or by the pair brace(s) plus
leg (for a K-joint). It is therefore important to have the direction
cosines of the interested members readily available to properly
manipulate and transform the local shear forces and bending moments.</p>
<p>When member cross sections other than circular are allowed in future
releases, the user will need to input cosine matrices to indicate the
final orientation of the member principal axes with respect to the
global reference frame.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Linear Finite-Element Beam Model</li>
</ol>
<p>In SubDyn, the LFEB can accommodate different two-node beam element
types, including Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam elements, either of
constant or tapered cross sections. The tapered element formulation has
been derived, but has not been implemented in the current SubDyn
release.</p>
<p>The uniform and tapered Euler-Bernoulli beam elements are
displacement-based and use third-order interpolation functions that
guarantee the displacement and rotation continuity between elements. The
uniform Timoshenko beam element is derived by introducing the shear
deformation into the uniform Euler-Bernoulli element, so the
displacements are represented by third-order interpolation functions as
well.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Element Formulation</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the classic Timoshenko beam theory, the generic two-node
element stiffness and consistent mass matrices can be written as follows
(see, for instance, Panzer et al. 2009):</p>
<p>where is the element cross-section area, are the area second moments of
inertia with respect to principal axes of the cross section; is the
length of the undisplaced element from start-node to end-node; , <em>E,</em>

<p>where the shear areas along the local <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (principal) axes are
defined as:</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Eq. is from Steinboeck et al. (2013) for hollow circular cross sections,

<p>Before assembling the global system stiffness (<em>K</em>) and mass (<em>M</em>)
matrices, the individual and are modified to the global coordinate

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Self-Weight Loads</li>
</ol>
<p>The loads caused by self-weight are precomputed during initialization
based on the undisplaced configuration. It is therefore assumed that the
displacements will be small and that P-delta effects are small for the
substructure. For a nontapered beam element, the lumped loads caused by
gravity to be applied at the end nodes are as follows (in the global
coordinate system):</p>
<p>Note also that if lumped masses exist (selected by the user at
prescribed joints), their contribution will be included as concentrated
forces along global <em>Z</em> at the relevant nodes.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Dynamic System of Equations and C-B Reduction</li>
</ol>
<p>The main equations of motion of SubDyn are written as follows:</p>
<p>where and are the global mass and stiffness matrices of the substructure
beam frame, assembled from the element mass and stiffness matrices.
Additionally, and contain the contribution from any specified and that

from a system point of view as shown in the following paragraphs. A
derivative with respect to time is represented by a dot, so that and are
the first- and second-time derivatives of , respectively.</p>
<p>The number of DOFs associated with Eq. can easily grow to the thousands
for typical beam frame substructures. That factor, combined with the
need for time-domain simulations of turbine dynamics, may seriously slow
down the computational efficiency of aeroelastic codes such as FAST
(note that a typical wind turbine system model in ElastoDyn has about 20
DOFs). For this reason, a C-B methodology was used to recharacterize the
substructure finite-element model into a reduced DOF model that
maintains the fundamental low-frequency response modes of the structure.
With the C-B method, the DOFs of the substructure can be reduced to
about 10 (user defined, see also Section ). This system reduction method
was first introduced by Hurty (1964) and later expanded by Craig and
Bampton (1968).</p>
<p>In SubDyn’s C-B reduction, the substructure nodes are separated into two
groups: 1) the boundary nodes (identified with a subscript “<em>R</em>” in
what follows) that include the nodes fully restrained at the base of the
structure and the interface nodes; and 2) the interior nodes (or
leftover nodes, identified with a subscript “<em>L</em>”). The interface
nodes are assumed rigidly connected among one another and to the TP
reference point. Note that the DOFs of partially restrained or “free”
nodes at the base of the structure are included in the “L” subset in
this version of SubDyn that contains SSI capabilities.</p>
<p>The derivation of the system reduction is shown below. After the LFEB
assembly, the system equation of motion of Eq. can be partitioned as
follows:</p>
<p>where the subscript denotes the boundary DOFs (there are <em>R</em> DOFs), and
the subscript the interior DOFs (there are <em>L</em> DOFs).</p>
<p>In Eq. , the applied forces include external forces (e.g., hydrodynamic
forces and those transmitted through the TP to the substructure) and
gravity forces , which are considered static forces lumped at each node.
The forces at the boundary nodes can be broken down into hydrodynamic
forces and those transferred to and from ElastoDyn via the TP, thus:</p>
<p>The fundamental assumption of the C-B method is that the contribution to
the displacement of the interior nodes can be simply approximated by a
subset (<em>m</em> ? <em>L</em>) of the interior generalized DOFs (). The relationship
between physical DOFs and generalized DOFs can be written as:</p>
<p>where is the identity matrix; (<em>L</em>×<em>R</em> matrix) represents the
physical displacements of the interior nodes for static, rigid body
motions at the boundary (interface nodes’ DOFs, because the restrained
nodes’ DOFs are locked by definition). By considering the homogeneous,
static version of , the second row can be manipulated to yield:</p>

<p>where the brackets have been removed for simplicity.</p>
<p>(<em>L</em>×<em>L</em> matrix) represents the internal eigenmodes, i.e., the
natural modes of the system restrained at the boundary (interface and
bottom nodes), and can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem:</p>
<p>The eigenvalue problem in Eq. leads to the reduced basis of generalized
modal DOFs , which are chosen as the first few (<em>m</em>) eigenvectors that
are arranged by increasing eigenfrequencies. is mass normalized, so
that:</p>
<p>By then reducing the number of generalized DOFs to <em>m</em> (? <em>L</em>), is
chosen to denote the truncated set of (keeping <em>m</em> of the total internal
modes, hence <em>m</em> columns), and is the diagonal (<em>m</em>×<em>m</em>) matrix
containing the corresponding eigenfrequencies. In SubDyn, the user
decides how many modes to retain, including possibly zero or all modes.
Retaining zero modes corresponds to a Guyan (static) reduction;
retaining all modes corresponds to keeping the full finite-element
model.</p>
<p>The C-B transformation is therefore represented by:</p>
<p>By using Eq. , the interior DOFs are hence transformed from physical
DOFs to modal DOFs, and by pre-multiplying both sides of Eq. by , and
making use of Eq. , Eq. can be rewritten as:</p>
<p>Eq. assumes that:</p>
<p>In other words, the only damping matrix term retained is the one
associated with internal DOF damping. This assumption has implications
on the damping at the interface with the turbine system, as discussed in
Section 5.4. The diagonal (<em>m</em>×<em>m</em>) matrix contains the modal
damping ratios corresponding to each retained internal mode. In SubDyn,
the user provides damping ratios (in percent of critical damping
coefficients) for the retained modes.</p>
<p>The matrix partitions in Eq. are calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Next, the boundary nodes are partitioned into those at the interface, ,
and those at the bottom, which are fixed:</p>
<p>The overhead bar here and below denotes matrices/vectors after the
fixed-bottom boundary conditions are applied. The interface nodes are
treated as rigidly connected to the TP, hence it is convenient to use
rigid-body TP DOFs (one node with 6 DOFs at the TP reference point) in
place of the interface DOFs. The interface DOFs, , and the TP DOFs are
related to each other as follows:</p>
<p>where is a matrix, is the number of interface nodes, and is the 6 DOFs
of the rigid transition piece. The matrix can be written as follows:</p>

<p>In terms of TP DOFs, the system equation of motion after the boundary
constraints are applied (the rows and columns corresponding to the DOFs

<p>During initialization, SubDyn calculates: the parameter matrices , ; the
gravity arrays and ; and the internal frequency matrix . The
substructure response at each time step can then be obtained by using
the state-space formulation discussed in the next section.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>State-Space Formulation</li>
</ol>
<p>A state-space formulation of the substructure structural dynamics
problem was devised to integrate SubDyn within the FAST modularization
framework. The state-space formulation was developed in terms of inputs,
outputs, states, and parameters. The notations highlighted here are
consistent with those used in Jonkman (2013). Inputs (identified by <em>u</em>)
are a set of values supplied to SubDyn that, along with the states, are
needed to calculate future states and the system’s output. Outputs (<em>y</em>)
are a set of values calculated by and returned from SubDyn that depend
on the states, inputs, and/or parameters through output equations (with
functions <em>Y</em>). States are a set of internal values of SubDyn that are
influenced by the inputs and used to calculate future state values and
the output. In SubDyn, only continuous states are considered. Continuous
states (<em>x</em>) are states that are differentiable in time and
characterized by continuous time differential equations (with functions
<em>X</em>). Parameters (<em>p</em>) are a set of internal system values that are
independent of the states and inputs. Furthermore, parameters can be
fully defined at initialization and characterize the system’s state
equations and output equations.</p>
<p>In SubDyn, the inputs are defined as:</p>
<p>where are the hydrodynamic forces on every interior node of the
substructure from HydroDyn, and are the analogous forces at the boundary
nodes; , , and are TP deflections (6 DOFs), velocities, and
accelerations, respectively. For SubDyn in stand-alone mode (uncoupled
from FAST), and are assumed to be zero.</p>
<p>In first-order form, the states are defined as:</p>
<p>From the system equation of motion, the state equation corresponding to
Eq. can be written as a standard linear system state equation:</p>
<p>where</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In SubDyn, the outputs to the ElastoDyn module are the reaction forces
at the transition piece</div>
<div class="line">:</div>
</div>
<p>By examining Eq. , the output equation for can be found as:</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>Note that the overbar is used on the input vector to denote that the
forces apply to the interface nodes only.</p>
<p>The outputs to HydroDyn and other modules are the deflections,
velocities, and accelerations of the substructure:</p>
<p>The output equation for can then be written as:</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>,,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Member Force Calculation</li>
</ol>
<p>SubDyn can also calculate member forces by starting from the forces
computed at the nodes of the elements that are contained in the member
as:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">where [<em>k</em>] and [<em>m</em>] are element stiffness and mass matrices, respectively. And
<span class="math">\(U_e\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\dsot{U}_e`are element nodal deflections and accelerations respectively,
which can be obtained from Eq. :eq:`y2\)</span>.</div>
</div>
<p>There is no good way to quantify the damping forces for each element, so
the element damping forces are not calculated.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Reaction Calculation</li>
</ol>
<p>The reactions at the base of the structure are the member forces at the
base nodes. These are usually provided in member local reference frames.
Additionally, the user may request an overall reaction
<span class="math">\(\overrightarrow{R}\)</span> (six forces and moments) lumped at the center
of the substructure (tower centerline) and mudline, i.e., at the
reference point (0,0,-<strong>*WtrDpth*</strong>) in the global reference frame, with
<strong>*WtrDpth*</strong> denoting the water depth. <span class="math">\(\overrightarrow{R}\)</span> is a
six-element array that can be calculated in matrix form as follows:</p>
<p>:math:<a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">`</span></a>overrightarrow{R} = begin{bmatrix}
F_{X} \</p>
<blockquote>
<div>vdots \</div></blockquote>
<p>M_{Z} \
end{bmatrix} = T_{text{React}}F_{text{React}}`</p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(F_{\text{React}}\)</span> is a (6*N<sub>react`*) array
containing the forces and moments at the *N:sub:`react`* restrained
nodes in the global coordinate frame, and :math:`T_{text{React}}</sub> is a
(6×6*N:sub:<a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">`</span></a>react`*) matrix, as follows:</p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(X\)</span><em>:sub:`i`</em>, <span class="math">\(Y\)</span><em>:sub:`i`</em>, and
<span class="math">\(Z\)</span><em>:sub:`i`</em> (<em>i</em>=1..<em>N:sub:`react`</em>) are coordinates of
the boundary nodes with respect to the reference point. For each element
with a restrained node, <span class="math">\(F_{\text{React}}\)</span> is calculated starting
from —see Eq. —subtracting out the contributions of gravity—, see Eq.
—and hydrodynamic loads () at the restrained node. No direct
element-level inertial or damping effect is therefore included in the
reaction calculation.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Time Integration</li>
</ol>
<p>At time , the initial states are specified as initial conditions (all
assumed to be zero in SubDyn) and the initial inputs are supplied to
SubDyn. During each subsequent time step, the inputs and states are
known values, with the inputs coming from ElastoDyn and HydroDyn, and
the states known from the previous time-step integration. All of the
parameter matrices are calculated in the SubDyn initiation module. With
known and , can be calculated using the state equation (see Eq. ), and
the outputs and can be calculated solving Eqs. and . The element forces
can also be calculated using Eq. . The next time-step states are
obtained by integration:</p>
<p>For loose coupling, SubDyn uses its own integrator, whereas for tight
coupling, the states from all the modules will be integrated
simultaneously using an integrator in the glue-code. SubDyn’s built-in
time integrator options for loose coupling are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta</li>
<li>Fourth-order explicit Adams-Bashforth predictor</li>
<li>Fourth-order explicit Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector</li>
<li>Implicit second-order Adams-Moulton.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, consult any numerical methods reference, e.g.,
Chapra and Canale (2010).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Static-Improvement Method</li>
</ol>
<p>To account for the effects of static gravity (member self-weight) and
buoyancy forces, one would have to include all of the structural axial
modes in the C-B reduction. This inclusion often translates into
hundreds of modes to be retained for practical problems. An alternative
method is thus promoted to reduce this limitation and speed up SubDyn.
This method is denoted as SIM, and computes two static solutions at each
time step: one based on the full system stiffness matrix and one based
on the reduced stiffness matrix. The dynamic solution then proceeds as
described in the previous sections, and at each time step the
time-varying dynamic solution is superimposed on the difference between
the two static solutions, which amounts to quasi-statically accounting
for the contribution of those modes not directly included within the
dynamic solution.</p>
<p>Recalling the previous C-B formulation , and adding the total static
deflection of all the internal DOFs (), and subtracting the static
deflection associated with C-B modes (), the SIM formulation is cast as
in :</p>
<p>Eq. can be rewritten as:</p>
<p>with:</p>
<p>where and are the <em>m</em> and <em>L</em> modal coefficients that are assumed to be
operating in a static fashion. For Eqs. and to be valid, and are
calculated under the C-B hypothesis that the boundary nodes are fixed.</p>
<p>The static displacement vectors can also be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>By making use of , and by pre-multiplying both sides times , Eq. can be
rewritten as: or, recalling that , as: , or equivalently in terms of :</p>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<p>Note that: and .</p>
<p>The dynamic component is calculated following the usual procedure
described in Sections 6.5.1-6.5.4. For example, states are still
calculated and integrated as in Eq. , and the output to ElastoDyn, i.e.,
the reaction provided by the substructure at the TP interface, is also
calculated as it was done previously in Eqs. and .</p>
<p>However, the state-space formulation is slightly modified to allow for
the calculation of the outputs to HydroDyn as:</p>
<p>where the matrices now have the following meaning:</p>
<p>,,</p>
<p>Finally, the element forces can be calculated as:</p>
<p>with the element node DOFs expressed as:</p>
<p>where the SIM decomposition is still used with , denoting the
time-varying components of the elements nodes’ displacements and and are
derived from the parent and arrays of displacements, respectively.</p>

<li>Known Limitations and Future Work</li>
</ol>
<p>The following list contains known current limitations in the code:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tight coupling is not yet supported.</li>
<li>Only nontapered two-node Euler-Bernoulli (E-B) or Timoshenko (T)
element formulations are available. (In the future, tapered E-B and
tapered Timoshenko element formulations will be implemented.)</li>
<li>Only straight circular members are permitted. (In the future, a
generic cross section will be allowed.)</li>
<li>The number of elements per member (<strong>*NDiv*</strong>) is constant throughout
the structure.</li>
<li>Internal matrices are not stored in sparse form, limiting the total
number of possible nodes/DOFs to about 300/1800.</li>

loading (e.g., hydrodynamic added mass).</li>
<li>Gravitational loading does not impact the global substructure
stiffness.</li>
<li>Loads (gravitational, inertial, hydrodynamic) can only be applied as
concentrated loads at element nodes; distributed loads (per unit
length) are not yet supported.</li>
<li>The overlap of multiple members connected to a single joint is not
modeled with super-elements.</li>
<li>Member-level outputs are only available for up to nine nodes of up to

<p>Appendix D. List of Output Channels</p>
<p>This is a list of all possible output parameters for the SubDyn module.
The names are grouped by meaning, but can be ordered in the OUTPUT
CHANNELS section of the SubDyn input file as the user sees fit. M?N?,
refers to node ? of member ?, where ? is a number in the range [1,9] and
corresponds to row ? in the MEMBER OUTPUT LIST table (see Section ) and
? is a number in the range [1,9] and corresponds to node ? in the
<strong>*NodeCnt*</strong> list of that table entry.</p>
<p>Some outputs are in the SS reference coordinate system (global
inertial-frame coordinate system), and end with the suffix ‘ss’; others
refer to the local (member) reference system and they have suffixes
‘Xe’, ‘Ye’, or ‘Ze’ (see Section 7).</p>
<p>Table C-1. List of Output Channels.</p>
<p>Appendix E. Compiling Stand-Alone SubDyn</p>
<p>See the FAST documentation for instructions on how to compile SubDyn
coupled to FAST.</p>
<p>Future versions of the manual will include compiling instructions for
building the stand-alone SubDyn program.</p>
<p>Appendix F. Major Changes in SubDyn</p>
<p>When first released, SubDyn (v0.4) was included as an undocumented
feature of FAST v8 and packaged as a stand-alone archive. Since v0.4,
SubDyn has been well integrated into FAST v8 and the stand-alone form is
also available. This appendix outlines significant modifications to
SubDyn made since v0.4. Following are the main changes that the user may
notice, but for more information, refer to the <em>changelog.txt</em> text file
within the official archive.</p>
<p>V1.01.01a-rrd (September 2014)</p>
<p>Version 1.01.01a-rrd integrates with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/fast8">*FAST v8
software*</a>
v8.09.00a-bjj.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Finite-element eigenvalue bug fixes: the full system eigenvalues were
incorrectly reported in the summary file, although with no further
consequences on the results. This bug is now fixed.</li>
<li>Shear area correction factor improvement: the shear area correction
factor in the Timoshenko treatment is now aligned with Steinboeck et
al. (2013).</li>
<li>The formulation for the TP reaction has been rearranged to adhere to
the theory manual, with no consequences on the output results.</li>
</ul>
<p>V1.01.00a-rrd (June 2014)</p>
<p>Version 1.00.01a-rrd integrates with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/fast8">*FAST v8
software*</a>
v8.08.00c-bjj.</p>
<p>The new implementation has well-defined data exchange interfaces
(<a class="reference external" href="http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/developers/">following the FAST modularization
framework</a>)
that should make integration of SubDyn into other multiphysics software
packages much simpler.</p>
<p>Several improvements and bug fixes have been implemented since version
v0.4 and the module has undergone an extensive verification effort with
good results.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Eigensolver bug fixes: the LAPACK solver proved to be unstable in
single precision, and now it is solely run in double precision,
regardless of the precision used in other parts of the code.</li>
<li>The input file format has changed. Please refer to the sample input
file in Appendix A and the following notes:<ul>
<li>First header line has been removed.</li>
<li>Simulation Control Section:<ul>
<li><strong>*SDeltaT*</strong>: The ‘DEFAULT’ keyword (in place of 0.0) is now
used to indicate that the glue-code time step will be used for
time integration by SubDyn.</li>
<li><strong>*IntMethod*</strong>: Allowed values are now 1?4 (in place of 0?3).</li>
<li><strong>*SttcSolve*</strong>: New flag introduced. If set to TRUE, the
static-improvement method (SIM) will be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FEA and Craig-Bampton Parameters Section:<ul>
<li>In v0.4, the damping coefficients had to be specified for all
retained Craig-Bampton modes, or just once for all the modes
(if <strong>*CBMod*</strong> = FALSE). In this version, the user can input
any number of damping coefficients. In case the number of
retained C-B modes (<strong>*NModes*</strong>) is larger than the input
number of damping coefficients (<strong>*JDampings*</strong>), the last
damping value will be replicated for all the remaining modes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Base Reaction Joints, Interface Joints, Member, and Member Cosine
Matrices Sections:<ul>
<li>One line with units, below the headers, is expected in all the
tables of the input file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Output: Summary and Outfile Section:<ul>
<li>This section now also contains the parameters previously
assigned under the Section titled “Output: Fast/Subdyn
Output-File Variables”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some of the quantities in the summary file have been fixed. Some of
the output matrices were, in fact, being output with wrong values
because of an index mismatch. The new summary file is shorter and
does not contain some of the CB method matrices, unless the compiler
directive, DEBUG, is set.</li>
<li>SIM. This new implementation helps minimize the number of needed
modes to capture the contribution of certain loads (such as static
gravity and buoyancy loads or high-frequency loads transferred from
the turbine). In the previous version, a large number of internal
modes were needed to engage substructural modes excited by static and
high-frequency forces. These modes are no longer needed and fewer
modes can be retained while still achieving accurate results (see
also Section 6). With SIM enabled, all modes that are not considered
by the Craig-Bampton reduction are treated quasi-statically.</li>
<li>There is now the possibility of retaining no internal C-B modes, thus
