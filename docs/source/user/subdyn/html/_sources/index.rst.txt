SubDyn User Guide and Theory Manual
======================================

.. only:: html

   This manual offers both a quick reference guide and a more in-depth theory guide for the SubDyn software program. 
   It is intended to be used by the general user in combination with the FAST and HydroDyn manuals. 
   The manual will be updated as new releases are issued and as needed to provide further information on advancements or modifications to the software.
   

   The authors would like to acknowledge Huimin Song, a post-doctoral researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 
   for her contribution to the development of SubDyn. Amy Robertson and Fabian Wendt provided helpful feedback on the document, 
   and Braulio Barahona produced some of the graphics. 
   We also are grateful to the U.S. Department of Energy Wind and Water Power Program for supporting the development of this software.
